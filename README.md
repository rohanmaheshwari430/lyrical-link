# lyrical-link


Do you like songs about the beach? Or maybe songs about love? Do you wish you could find more songs about your favoite topics?

Lyrical link is a lyrics based song recommender that finds semantically similar songs based on their lyrics. Harnessing the power of OpenAI's text embedding model, along with Pinecone's vector database, we compute songs that have the same meaning, and talk about the same topics.
