[Aminé:]
I, yeah, I, hey
Hey-ey, uh
Hey, uh

I was down, yeah, now I'm better (ayy)
Stuntin' with my dogs like my first name Cruella (woof)
Black girls love me 'cause a nigga got some feta (true)
And white girls love me like my first name Coachella (woo)
I'm a... kick drum (woo) I go pretty dumb (ayy)
West side nigga, 5-0-tree is where I'm from (true)
Lookin' at my face, you could tell I know my place (I do)
You say, "Amen," I say, "Aminé"
Right after I say my grace

[Aminé & Nelly:]
I wanna flex, I wanna show off
Humble when I'm blunt, but I gotta go hard
You're damn right, I'm feelin' myself
You know you'd do the same if that was yourself

[Aminé:]
I was broke (broke) now I'm stuntin' like my daddy
Flyest under the sea, I'm gettin' Krabby Patties (true)
Dukes gave me deuce so this beef feel like it's cavi'
Dreadlock nigga so my hair's pretty nappy (woo)
Boppers give me love (love), I could give a fuck (no)
Young Metro said he trust her so I gave the girl a hug (hey)
Well I got a bag of tricks, I don't do the politics (true, true)
I rock yellow on some yellow like what purple is to Prince

[Aminé & Nelly:]
I wanna flex, I wanna show off
Humble when I'm blunt, but I gotta go hard
You're damn right, I'm feelin' myself
You know you'd do the same if that was yourself
I wanna flex (woo), I wanna show off (hey)
Humble when I'm blunt, but I gotta go hard (yeah)
You're damn right, I'm feelin' myself (true)
You know you'd do the same if that was yourself

[Nelly:]
We're all young and reckless
We fight for ourselves, it's true (it's true)
It's good to be selfish (sometimes)
'Cause most times they know they are too (hey)
We're all young and reckless
We fight for ourselves, it's true (it's true)
It's good to be selfish (sometimes)
'Cause most times they know they are too (hey)
