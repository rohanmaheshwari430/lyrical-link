Long live the king!\" One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was a wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know St. Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]  Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know St. Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world",

If you never try, then you'll never know. How long do I have to climb, Up on the side of this mountain of mine?  Look up, I look up at night. Planets are moving at the speed of light. Climb up, up in the trees. Every chance that you get is a chance you seize.  How long am I gonna stand With my head stuck under the sand? I'll start before I can stop, But before I see things the right way up.  All that noise and all that sound. All those places I got found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground. If you could see it then you'd understand.  Ideas that you'll never find, All the inventors could never design. The buildings that you put up. Japan and China all lit up.  The sign that I couldn't read Or a light that I couldn't see. Some things you have to believe, But others are puzzles, puzzling me.  All that noise and all that sound. All those places I got found. And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began.  Birds came flying from the underground. If you could see it then you'd understand. Ah, when you see it then you'll understand.  All those signs— I knew what they meant. Some things you can invent. Some get made, and some get sent. Ooh.  And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began. Birds came flying from the underground. If you could see it then you'd understand. Ah, when you see it then you'll understand.",

Was a long and dark December When the banks became cathedrals And a fox became God  Priests clutched onto Bibles Hollowed out to fit their rifles And a cross was held aloft  Bury me in armour When I'm dead and hit the ground My nerves are poles that unfroze  And if you love me, won't you let me know?  I don't want to be a soldier Who the captain of some sinking ship Would stow, far below  So if you love me, why d'you let me go?  I took my love down to Violet Hill There we sat in snow All that time she was silent still  Said if you love me, won't you let me know? If you love me, won't you let me know?",

When it's such… It's such a perfect day It's such a perfect day  Ah-ah-ah-ah-iiiiii  Now the sky could be blue I don't mind Without you it's a waste of time  Could be blue I don't mind Without you it's a waste of time  Now the sky could be blue Could be grey Without you I'm just miles away  Oh the sky could be blue I don't mind Without you it's a waste of time",

Have they all got the bends? Am I really sinking this low?  My baby's got the bends, oh no We don't have any real friends No, no, no  Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen  Where do we go from here? The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear And where are you? They brought in the CIA The tanks and the whole marines To blow me away To blow me sky high  My baby's got the bends We don't have any real friends  Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen  I wanna live, breathe I wanna be a part of the human race I wanna live, breathe I wanna be a part of the human race Race, race, race  Where do we go from here?

Where you come from And where you wanna go this time, oh Tell me, lover Are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh Tell me baby What's your story Where do you come from And where you wanna go this time, oh You're so lovely Are you lonely? Giving up on the innocence you left behind  Some claim to have the fortitude Too shrewd to blow the interlude Sustaining pain to set a mood Step out to be renewed I'll move you like a baritone Jungle Brothers on the microphone Getting over with an undertone It's time to turn to stone Chitty chitty baby When your nose is in the nitty gritty Life could be a little sweet But life could be a little shitty What a pity Boston and a Kansas City Looking for a hundred But you only ever found a fifty Three fingers in the honeycomb You ring just like a xylophone Devoted to the chromosome The day that you left home  Tell me baby What's your story? Where you come from And where you wanna go this time, oh Tell me lover Are you lonely?

Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage Bet you never could imagine Never told you you could have it  You needed me Ooh, you needed me To feel a little more, and give a little less Know you hate to confess But baby ooh, you needed me  You been rolling around, shit I'm rolling up Light and roll it up Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us Shit was never us That's the real, on the real, are you serious? How you feel, how you feel? Used to trip off that shit I was kicking to ya Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya  But baby, don't get it twisted You was just another nigga on the hit list Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?

We're gonna have a problem here  Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door And started whooping her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!) It's the return of the... \"Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?\" And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!) Feminist women love Eminem [*Vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*] \"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what Flipping the you-know-who.\" \"Yeah, but he's so cute though!\" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose \"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They got the Discovery Channel, don't they? \"We ain't nothing but mammals..\" Well, some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*] But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope [*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes  'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?  'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me \"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\" Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears? Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV \"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!\" I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?  I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings [*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling Screaming \"I don't give a fuck!\" With his windows down and his system up So, will the real Shady please stand up? And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Man, how's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan This is Stan  [Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Eminem as Stan:] Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew That's my little brother man, he's only six years old We waited in the blistering cold for you For four hours and you just said, \"No\" That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're saying in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together, too  [Dido:] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Eminem as Stan:] Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans, This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins \"In the Air Tonight\" About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See, Slim,—shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk! Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk, But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother I wrote it on the Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too? I say that shit's just clowning , dawg C'mon! How fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was... it was you Damn!",

Shh, mama's only gone for the moment  Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise mama's gon' be alright  And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)",

There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire I'm just gonna  Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie",

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap His step-father hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose, his house is a broken home There's no control, he just lets his emotions go  (Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh) I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B It's all political, if my music is literal And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)  (Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!) Sing it with me, it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!) Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…  Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)

And look where it's at Middle America, now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city Having this happening (this happening) Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way) But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire To burn and it's burning and I have returned  And I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're comin' with me, feel it or not You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Until the roof, until the roof The roof comes off, the roof comes off Until my legs, until my legs Give out from underneath me I, I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one could beat me",

Excuse me For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated When I blew; see, but it was confusing 'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)

No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)

And if he is as bananas as you say I'm not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered  I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot  But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissing match With this rappity brat Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac Backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop \"F\" bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period Here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah  'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap Immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (pew) MCs get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bust a rhyme' Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You fags think it's all a game 'Til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, looking boy You're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy Oy vey, that boy's gay That's all they say, looking boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, looking boy Hey, looking boy, what d'you say, looking boy? I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, looking boy I'mma work for everything I have Never asked nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy Basically boy you're never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause  I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard  So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin You're rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off then I'm reloading Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walking dead But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating But I got your mom deep-throating I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothing in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself In the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me My honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize What I do though for good At least once in a while so I wanna make sure Somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to Maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes But sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to Censor you like that one line I said On \"I'm Back\" from The Mathers LP One when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line Add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now That I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel With fucking cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal And I just bought a new ray gun from the future Just to come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag At Mayweather's pad singin' to a man While he played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special On the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day \"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\" Lyrics coming at you with supersonic speed, (JJ Fad) Uh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is Ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music You make elevator music \"Oh, he's too mainstream.\" Well, that's what they do When they get jealous, they confuse it \"It's not hip-hop, it's pop.\" 'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it \"I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use.\" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to Unghh, school flunky, pill junky But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk. So, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'm asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz Still \"Chunky, but Funky\" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and Here's what they want from me They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it Life's handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?",

It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him Fuck it 50 smash him! Mash on him and let him have it Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willin' to be the bigger man If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause  Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers",

I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to \"The Eminem Show\"  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet  I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry mama! I never meant to hurt you!

I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be Like trying to start over I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you You take my breath away You're a supernova... and I'm a  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Right at you  I'll do whatever it takes When I'm with you I get the shakes My body aches when I ain't With you I have zero strength There's no limit on how far I would go No boundaries, no lengths Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same? You want them when they don't want you Soon as they do feelings change It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take Let's cut to the chase 'Fore a door shuts in your face Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open That I won't be making a mistake Cause I'm a...  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Right at you  So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want But I love you so much it hurts Never mistreated you once I poured my heart out to you Let down my guard swear to God I'll blow my brains in your lap Lay here and die in your arms Drop to my knees and I'm pleading I'm trying to stop you from leaving You won't even listen so fuck it I'm trying to stop you from breathing I put both hands on your throat I sit on top of you squeezing 'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house And let you live Tears stream down both of my cheeks Then I let you go and just give And before I put that gun to my temple I told you this  And I would have did anything for you To show you how much I adored you But it's over now It's too late to save our love Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...  I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June And I'm so lost without you Without you Without you",

    "lyrics": "Yeah... It's my life... In my own words I guess...  Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armour And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? \"Daddy, look what I made\", Dad's gotta go catch a plane \"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?\" I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...  And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back...  I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing \"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?\" Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. \"Daddy, you're lying. You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine.\" She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it \"Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!\" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, \"This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you.\" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em They're saying, \"You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight. Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.\" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on And I'm singing...  And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back...  Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing \"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding.\" But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? \"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'. \"You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad. And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'. That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin. I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going.\" But, baby, wait. \"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice. Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.\" That's what they want, they want you Marshall They keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me? I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain, scream, \"Die Shady!\" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes, The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes And burns to ashes That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister Almost as if to say  And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, So, baby, don't feel no pain Just smile back...

[Eminem:] I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump, I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles  In my shoes, just to see What it's like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh, they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you, yeah, so...  I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything is so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room Just as soon as I walk in It's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact 'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fucking man servant Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of them ain't even funny like \"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn\" Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles  In my shoes, just to see What it's like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful Oh they can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so  Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip them, don't expect no help Now I could have either just Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in In every single place Every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid  Aunt Edna always told me \"Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that\" Meanwhile I'm just standin' there Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description 'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting It's probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes, at least What size you wear? I wear tens Let's see if you can fit your feet  In my shoes, just to see What it's like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh They can all get fucked.

Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath You know what you've done no need to go in depth I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left I'd laugh while you wept How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it? You neglected me Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set But a special place for you in my heart I have kept It's unfortunate but it's  Too late for the other side (Yeah) Caught in a chase 25 to life (Can't take no more) Too late for the other side Caught in a chase 25 to life  I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh 'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half 'Til I snap Don't think I'm loyal All I do is rap How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you? Jealous when I spend time with the girls Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know But tonight I'm serving you with papers I'm divorcing you Go marry someone else and make 'em famous And take away their freedom like you did to me Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat I'm moving on forget you oh Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you All I ever felt was this Helplessness Imprisoned by a selfish bitch Chew me up and spit me out I fell for this so many times It's ridiculous And still I stick with this I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction You're addictive as they get Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from I'm addicted To the pain, the stress, the drama I'm drawn in so I guess I'm a mess Cursed and blessed But this time I Ain't changing my mind I'm climbing out this abyss You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you You left me off your list  Fuck you hip-hop I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch And it's just  Too late for the other side Caught in a chase 25 to life (I'm gone, man) Too late for the other side Caught in a chase 25 to life Too late Caught in a chase 25 to life",

    "lyrics": "'Cause sometimes you just feel tired Yo, left, yo, left Feel weak and when you feel weak Yo, left, right, left You feel like you wanna just give up Yo, left, yo left But you gotta search within you Yo, left, right, left Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you Yo, left, yo left And get that motivation to not give up Yo, left, right, left And not be a quitter, no matter how bad Yo, left, yo left You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse Yo, left, right, left  'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em 'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em 'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em? Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're comin' with me, feel it or not You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so  'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out Until the roof, until the roof 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth The roof comes off, the roof comes off 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps Until my legs, until my legs I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse Give out from underneath me  Until the roof, until the roof The roof comes off, the roof comes off Until my legs, until my legs Give out from underneath me I, I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one could beat me",

Am I just wastin' my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no  'Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin' on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me  My baby girl keeps gettin' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no  'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin' on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me  Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't ['want her' backwards] Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul And just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin' But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—  Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin' on me 'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier Nothin' can take her from me  Wooo! Told you I can't sing Oh, well—I tried Hailie, 'member when I said If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there? Guess what—Daddy's here And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby I love you [*smooch*]",

I'm on a plain I can't complain I'm on a plain  Somewhere I have heard this before In a dream my memory has stored As a defense I'm neutered and spayed What the hell am I trying to say?  It is now time to make it unclear To write off lines that don't make sense  I love myself better than you I know it's wrong so what should I do?  And one more special message to go And then I'm done, and I can go home I love myself better than you I know it's wrong so what should I do?

One flag was taken down To raise another in its place A heavy cross you bear A stubborn heart remains unchanged No home, no life, no love No stranger singing in your name Maybe the season The colours change in the valley skies Dear God I've sealed my fate Running through hell, heaven can wait Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead end in sight Let's say we take this town No king or queen of any state Get up to shut it down Open the streets and raise the gates I know one wall to scale I know a field without a name Head on without a care Before it's way too late Maybe the season The colours change in the valley skies Oh, God I've sealed my fate Running through hell, heaven can wait Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead ends Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead end in sight For every piece to fall in place Forever gone without a trace Your horizon takes its shape No turning back, don't turn that page Come now, I'm leaving here tonight Come now, let's leave it all behind Is that the price you pay? Running through hell, heaven can wait Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead ends Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead ends Long road to ruin there in your eyes Under the cold streetlights No tomorrow, no dead end in sight",

I think I found my place Can't you feel it growin' stronger? Little conquerors I'm learnin' to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? I'm learnin' to talk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? Now For the very first time Don't you pay no mind Set me free again To keep alive a moment at a time But still inside a whisper to a riot To sacrifice but knowin' to survive The first to climb another state of mind I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign Forever, whenever, I never want to die I never want to die, I never want to die I'm on my knees, I never want to die I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire Forever, whenever, I never want to die I never want to leave, I never say goodbye Forever, whenever, forever, whenever I'm learnin' to walk again I believe I've waited long enough Where do I begin? I'm learnin' to talk again Can't you see I've waited long enough? Where do I begin?

Shut up when I'm talking to you Shut up, shut up, shut up Shut up when I'm talking to you Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up I'm about to break!

    "song": "Giorgio by Moroder",
    "lyrics": "When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible because it was— The dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, was studying. And when I finally broke away from school and became musician, I thought, \"Well, now, I may have a little bit of a chance.\" Because all I really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music. At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes.I think I had about 7-8 songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about—almost two years to survive, in the beginning, I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, \"Wait a second. I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?\" And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click. So, we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that it could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be. My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio. Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.",

Hey!) At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!) Signs misleading to nowhere City of the damned (Hey! Hey!) Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!) No one really seems to care I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall And so it seemed to confess It didn't say much, but it only confirmed That the center of the Earth is the end of the world And I could really care less City of the dead (Hey! Hey!) At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!) Signs misleading to nowhere City of the damned (Hey! Hey!) Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!) No one really seems to care (Hey!) [Part III: I Don't Care] I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't care I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't care I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't care I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't I don't care if you don't care I don't care! Everyone's so full of shit Born and raised by hypocrites Hearts recycled, but never saved From the cradles to the grave We are the kids of war and peace From Anaheim to the Middle East We are the stories and disciples of The Jesus of Suburbia! Land of make-believe And it don't believe in me Land of make-believe (Said it's, it's another lie!) And I don't believe And I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo) I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo) I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo) I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo) I don't care! [Part IV: Dearly Beloved] Dearly beloved, are you listening? I can't remember a word that you were saying Are we demented, or am I disturbed? The space that's in between insane and insecure Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void? (Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed? (Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused (Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh [Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home] To live and not to breathe Is to die in tragedy To run, to run away To find what you believe And I leave behind This hurricane of fucking lies I lost my faith to this This town that don't exist So I run, I run away To the lights of masochists And I leave behind This hurricane of fucking lies And I've walked this line A million and one fucking times But not this time! I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize When there ain't nowhere you can go Running away from pain when you've been victimized Tales from another broken Home You're leaving You're leaving You're leaving Are you leaving home?",

No time for motivation Smoking my inspiration, huh! I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling Call me pathetic, call me what you will (We will!) My mother says to get a job But she don't like the one she's got When masturbation's lost its fun You're fucking lonely Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And loneliness has to suffice Bite my lip and close my eyes I'm tripping away to paradise Some say quit or I'll go blind But it's just a myth",

What's in love is now in debt On your birth certificate So strike the fucking match to light this fuse! The town bishop is an extortionist And he don't even know that you exist Standing still when it's do or die You better run for your fucking life It's not over 'til you're underground It's not over before it's too late This city's burnin' It's not my burden It's not over before it's too late There's nothing left to analyze Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself? And where will we all go when it's too late? And don't look back You're not the Jesus of Suburbia The St. Jimmy is a figment of Your father's rage and your mother's love Made me the idiot America It's not over 'til you're underground It's not over before it's too late This city's burnin' It's not my burden It's not over before it's too late Well, she said, \"I can't take this place I'm leaving it behind.\" Well, she said, \"I can't take this town I'm leaving you tonight.\"",

What's your pleasure and what is your pain? Do you dream too much? Do you think what you need is a crutch? In the crowd of pain St. Jimmy comes without any shame He says, \"We're fucked up,\" but we're not the same And mom and dad are the ones you can blame Jimmy died today He blew his brains out into the bay In the state of mind It's my own private suicide [Part 2: East 12th St.] Well, nobody cares Well, nobody cares Does anyone care if nobody cares? Well, nobody cares Well, nobody cares Does anyone care if nobody cares? Jesus filling out paperwork now At the facility on East 12th St He's not listening to a word now He's in his own world and he's daydreaming He'd rather be doing something else now Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly His life's on the line with anxiety now And she had enough, and he had plenty Somebody get me out of here Anybody get me out of here Somebody get me out of here Get me the fuck right out of here So far away I don't want to stay Get me out of here right now I just wanna be free Is there a possibility? Get me out of here right now (Out, out, out, out) Right! This life like dream ain't for me [Part 3: Nobody Likes You!] [Written and sung by Mike Dirnt] I fell asleep while watching Spike TV After 10 cups of coffee and you're still not here Dreaming of a song But something went wrong And you can't tell anyone 'Cause no one's here Left me here alone And I should have stayed home After 10 cups of coffee I'm thinking (Where'd you go?) Nobody likes you, everyone left you (Where'd you go?) They're all out without you havin' fun (Where'd you go?) Everyone left you, nobody likes you (Where'd you go?) They're all out without you havin' fun (Where'd you go..go..go..go..) [Part 4: Rock And Roll Girlfriend] [Written and sung by Tre Cool] Geez! [*sigh*] I got a rock and roll band I got a rock and roll life I got a rock and roll girlfriend And another ex-wife I got a rock and roll house I got a rock and roll car I play the shit out the drums And I can play the guitar I got a kid in New York I got a kid in The Bay I haven't drank or smoked nothin' In over 22 days (Don't wanna be an American idiot) So get off my case Off of my case Off of my case [Part 5: We're Coming Home Again] Here they come marching down the street Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat Coming back from the edge of town Underneath their feet Their time has come and it's going nowhere Nobody ever said that life was fair now Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear In the summer heat The world is spinning 'round And 'round out of control again The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down So send my love a letterbomb And visit me in hell We're the ones going Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again I started fuckin' running As soon as my feet touched ground We're back in the Barrio But to you and me, that's Jingle Town that's Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again Home We're coming home again (You! Fuck off! Just go! I don't care! I don't! I don't know! I smashed my phone! Just go! I don't care! I don't! I don't know! I smashed my phone!)

If I had a nickel for every time, I'd own the bank. Thought that I was the exception, I could rewrite your addiction, You could've been the greatest, But you'd rather get wasted. You fall asleep during foreplay, 'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte. I'm not sticking around to watch you go down. Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother. Can't be your savior, I don't have the power. I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain. You say you have to write your rhymes, Whatever helps you sleep at night You've become what you despise, A stereotype You think you're so rock and roll, But you're really just a joke. Had the world in the palm of your hands, But you fucking choked Should've been my team mate, Could've changed your fate, You say that you love me, You won't remember in the morning. You fall asleep during foreplay, 'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte. I'm not sticking around to watch you go down. Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother. Can't be your savior, I don't have the power. I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain. You fall asleep during foreplay, 'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte. I'm not sticking around to watch you go down. Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother. Can't be your savior, I don't have the power. I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain. Watch you circle the drain, Watch you circle the drain. You're going down [4x] You fall asleep during foreplay, 'Cause the pills you take, are more your forte. I'm not sticking around to watch you go down.",

So pick yourself up, it's a brand new day So turn yourself round Don't burn yourself, turn youself Turn yourself around To the sun! To the sun, to the sun... To the sun, to the sun...",

    "song": "Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head",
    "lyrics": "Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain, there was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived, their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world, obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives, innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below. To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough. Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town. They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them: they only saw shadows. You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind. Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head Now everybody dancing the dance of the dead, The dance of the dead, The dance of the dead In time, Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain, and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty. By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest. The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things, and soon they began to mine the mountain, its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world. Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly, their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls. Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain. Why was it bringing darkness into their lives? And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear, bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey. For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep. And then came a sound. Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space. There were no screams. There was no time. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire. And then, nothing. O little town in U.S.A., your time has come to see There's nothing you believe you want But where were you when it all came down on me? Did you call me now?",
